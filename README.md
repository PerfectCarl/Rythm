**Notice** proposed by community, I decided to change the package name from `com.greenlaw110.rythm` to `org.rythmengine`

Rythm
=====

A "Razor" like, rich featured, high performance and easy to use Java template engine

Rythm is now 1 year old. It has been put into several real projects at least in China and Austrlia. 

Online document is still work in progress, but you can already read part on http://rythmengine.org/doc/index

A great fiddle tool can also help you learn and understand this template engine. Check it out at http://fiddle.rythmengine.org/

If you are using Play!framework 1.2.x, then you are lucky to have comprehensive document at http://www.playframework.com/modules/rythm, though most
of the content also applies to using rythm-engine in a pure Java environment.

For SpringMVC users, please checkout https://github.com/lawrence0819/spring-web-rythm-template.

I am now working hard to prepare it for R1.0 targeted Jun. The current work load is on improving tests, 
documentation and sample applications.

Just stay tuned!
